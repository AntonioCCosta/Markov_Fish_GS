You can find another application of this modelling approach to *C. elegans* [here](https://github.com/AntonioCCosta/markov_worm/tree/main). In addition, you can find working examples of the maximally-predictive Markov modelling in this [other repository](https://github.com/AntonioCCosta/maximally_predictive_states), and also a broader tutorial on quantitative approaches to animal behavior that includes our modelling approach in this [other repository](https://github.com/oist/Physics-of-Behavior-Tutorials).
